  <ItemDescription>k__BackingField: 'The veil between realms shrouds my perception.
    Am I but a wandering spirit, lost in the echoes of Horshaw House? The Faceless
    Monster''s malevolence extends even into this ethereal existence. I inscribe
    these words not as the living but as a spectral witness to the unfolding horrors.
    The mysteries deepen, and the Tillers remain ensnared, their fates entwined with
    the shadowed tapestry of this cursed mansion.


    In this ethereal realm, the
    skulls of the deceased become clearer, each whispering tales of the unspoken
    past. May the intrepid find meaning within their hollow gaze.'
