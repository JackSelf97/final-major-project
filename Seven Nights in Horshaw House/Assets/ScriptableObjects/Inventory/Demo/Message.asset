  <ItemDescription>k__BackingField: 'Dear Inspector Ward,


    Your immediate attention
    is required at Horshaw House. The Tillers, custodians of the mansion, are urgently
    seeking to sell the property in seven days. They insist that you locate and remove
    eight skulls of the deceased hidden within the house.


    A word of caution:
    Horshaw House harbors a sinister presence that emerges after dark. Your reputation
    for fearlessness and experience with the unexplained make you the ideal choice
    for this task. Please keep me updated on your progress and, if needed, seek assistance
    from local authorities.


    Godspeed and return safely.


    Yours sincerely,


    Detective
    Chief Inspector Robert Marlowe

    New Scotland Yard, London'
